# Getting-Started
first use of github - looking forward to it.

Hi all 

I am very interested in learning new things from you. I live in close environment (no one interested in programming / no professional programmers). I don’t know much about what’s new, market needs, etc.
I want to be professional programmer but don’t know where to start. I hope to get your guidance. 
If you have any project in mind I can start with I will be glade to do it.
